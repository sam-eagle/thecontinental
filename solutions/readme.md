# Solutions
A wise person said solutions have rules, standards & guidelines.
* Rules - Don't break the rules, or there will be consequences
* Standards - "Group think", recommendations, maybe even good advice; but they don't apply to every situation, and have exceptions
* Guidelines - "Guard rails", there to keep the soluton from going off the road; but won't stop oncoming traffic

# Walled Gardens
Defined as "a closed ecosystem or platform that restricts the flow of information (data) to and from external destinations".
The more one can stay within a single garden, typically the more productive or ease of integration one has.
